## Create Order Product Example

When you need to add a new product to an order, some extra steps might be required to obtain all relevant IDs. Here's an example on the steps required. 

### When missing `order` id

In the case that you have your own `externalRef`, that is your own reference specified for an `order`, you need to first use [Get All Orders](#get-all-orders) to retrieve our `order` id. For example, if you have the external references `ORD001` and `ORD002`, you can retrieve them when using the query string `filter[externalRef]=ORD001,ORD002`. Using the json response, you can map the ids accordingly.

### When missing `product` id

The most typical way to identify a product is using the `sku`. To retrieve our `product` ids with the skus `ART003` and `ART004`, you use [Get All Products](#get-all-products) with the query string `filter[sku]=ART003,ART004`. The returned json response can in the same way map ids accordingly. 

### Connecting the new `orderProduct`

```json
...,
"relationships": {
  "order": {
    "type": "order",
    "id": "OURREF001"
  },
  "product": {
    "type": "product",
    "id": "3"
  }
}
...
```

When creating the new `orderProduct`, apart from the attributes, you also need to define the `order` and `product` relationships. You must have access to both these resources, and it will throw an error if you attempt to insert a `product` that's already connected to the `order`.
